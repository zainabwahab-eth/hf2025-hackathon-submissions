## Project Title

LinkVault

## Project Description

LinkVault is a platform designed to help developers (and lifelong learners in general) organize, manage, and share their learning resources in one simple, structured space.
Users can create topic-based folders and fill them with helpful links to blogs, tutorials, courses, or videos.

Built with React (Vite) and Appwrite Cloud, LinkVault provides a seamless and collaborative learning experience.

## Inspiration behind the Project

As a developer, I constantly come across valuable learning materials from articles to video tutorials but they often get lost across browser tabs, notes, or chat bookmarks.
I wanted to build a tool that helps lifelong learners keep all their learning resources organized, searchable, and accessible from anywhere.
That desire to make learning more structured and intentional inspired the creation of LinkVault.
